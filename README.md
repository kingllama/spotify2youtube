A chrome extension to play music on youtube through spotify

Ever since Spotify came to Canada I'm routinely impressed by the sheer size of Spotify's library. Before spotify, If I wanted to listen to a song without buying it, I would have to go to youtube and listen to it there. This chrome extension bridges the gap between youtube and Spotify.

#### UPDATE: 2017:

This extension has been removed from chrome due to the use of copyrighted materials (specifically, Youtube's). If it were to ever come back, the Spotify API would also need to be updated.
